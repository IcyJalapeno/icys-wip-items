[WIP] Foundry VTT Items (Classes, SubClasses, etc..)  Personally Made

With the release of the (2024) Player's Handbook for 5th Edition and finally getting a copy for myself on Foundry VTT. Having joined a campaign, that's still ongoing, and needing to make myself a bunch of things for myself. I figured, no point of me keeping these to myself. Still trying to figure out, Mini-QoL. If anyone has any great videos for tutorials explaining how to properly use Mini-QoL, let me know. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.
